# Sonatrach-ROP-Prediction

Welcome to the Sonatrach ROP Prediction Challenge hosted by the `School of AI Algiers`!

## Overview

In this challenge, I developed a robust machine learning model to predict the Rate of Penetration (ROP) in drilling operations using real-world data provided by the renowned Algerian energy company, `Sonatrach`.

### The Challenge

The primary challenge in this project was dealing with a large number of features. To address this issue, I employed correlation analysis to identify and eliminate irrelevant or redundant features, which significantly improved the model's efficiency.

### Results

I'm thrilled to share that our model achieved impressive results, scoring an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 4. This exceptional performance secured our team the 2nd place on both the public and private leaderboards.
